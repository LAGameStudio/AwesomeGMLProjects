## Getting Started

- [GameMaker Manual](https://manual.gamemaker.io/)
- [GameMaker Release Notes](https://gms.yoyogames.com/ReleaseNotes.html)
- [GameMaker Marketplace](https://marketplace.gamemaker.io/)
- [Beginner GameMaker Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBCDzE9MDbk&list=PLPRT_JORnIur4v19PHXCtJ5P05vaokFdP) - Tutorials from Shaun Spalding. A comprehensive introduction to basic features of the IDE. Highly recommended to check out the full playlist if you're a complete beginner. ![YouTube](https://github.com/bytecauldron/awesome-gamemaker/raw/main/icons/youtube.png)
- [Advanced GameMaker Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8-MuIuOQFE&list=PL_hT--4HOvrfuDcYrTufdpgwoALAczPR2) - Tutorials from DragoniteSpam that dive into more advanced topics related to the GML language. They also have comprehensive 3D and shader introduction videos. ![YouTube](https://github.com/bytecauldron/awesome-gamemaker/raw/main/icons/youtube.png)

### Recommendations

- If you already have programming experience, learn the GameMaker Language (GML) instead of the Visual (Drag and Drop) feature.
- For pixel art, [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) is a popular alternative to the native sprite editor. 💸
  - [Aseprite's source code](https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite) can be compiled for free.
- Don't be afraid to use other developer libraries. A lot of them are free for a reason. Just be mindful of the license.
- Updates to the IDE and runtime can break your game (like syntax changes to GML). If you are working in a group, make sure you are running on the same version of GMS and only update when given a fair warning. You can reinstall previous versions of your IDE at the GMS download page.
- Unless your game requires complex physics interactions, it's generally advised to avoid GameMaker's built-in physics system.
- Schedule routine backups for projects. If you are dealing with larger media files in your repo, try [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/).
